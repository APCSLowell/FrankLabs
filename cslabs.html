        Use computational power to solve problems where the exact sequence of steps is not known in advance. 
        Develop a small group of possible solutions, try them out, see which ones worked best, then generate new 
        possibilites based on the best characteristics of the first generation.   New, better solutions replace old
        ones, with random mutations and roulette selection, until a solution is found.
